WHY USE raspberry Pi---
☺very low cost
☺greate tool for lrarning programming,computers and concepts of embedded system.
☺support and runs free and open source linux OS
☺consumes less than 5w of power
☺support full hd video output,multiple usb ports etc.


GIPO SETMODE
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
Board mode- take board number
BCM mode-take GPIO no

GPIO.setup= (2,GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.OUT= use to send signal
GPIO.output(2,GPIO.HIGH)=it will give output

GPIO.HIGH()= it will send 5 volt


IR sensor
range of IR is 2-7 cm
